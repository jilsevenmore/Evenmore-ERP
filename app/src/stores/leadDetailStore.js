/**
 * leadDetailStore — the sub-collections behind one lead's detail drawer.
 *
 * These lived in a single `evenmore-crm-lead-details-v1` blob in localStorage,
 * alongside a set of `build*` helpers that invented sources, emails, files and
 * a timeline whenever the blob was empty. Every one of those sections has a
 * real endpoint (`/crm/leads/{id}/notes/`, `/calls/`, `/files/`, …), so the
 * drawer now shows what the server has — including nothing, when there is
 * nothing.
 *
 * Sections are cached per lead so the ten call sites inside `LeadDetailView`
 * can stay synchronous reads of a snapshot.
